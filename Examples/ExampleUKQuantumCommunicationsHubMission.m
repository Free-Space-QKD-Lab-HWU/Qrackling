%% 
% # a transmitter (here, a satellite)
% # a receiver (here, a ground station)
% # run simulations
% # plot results
%% 1. construct a transmitter (satellite)
% to do this, we need lots of details about the satellite, including:
%% 
% * 1.1 quantum transmitter details
% * 1.2 beacon details (optional)
% * 1.3 orbit details then we can
% * 1.4 construct satellite
% 1.1.1 source

% 1.2.1 
% downlink beacon laser details see the above paper for beacon details. beacon 
% simulations are optional and do not affect quantum channel performance (as pointing 
% performance is specified by a jitter value)

% beacon wavelength in nm
downlink_beacon_wavelength = 685;


% create a beacon telescope object
downlink_beacon_telescope = components.Telescope( ...

% then include this telescope in the beacon object. This uses a flat-top beacon profile but a gaussian beacon is also available

% 1.2.2 downlink beacon camera details

% 1.3 orbit details
% there are many parameters which describe an orbit. we choose to use keplerian 
% parameters. as well as these, we must also provide a time window to simulate 
% (ideally, the satellite would pass the ground station in this time)

% orbital parameters- these conform to the MATLAB satellite communications toolbox keplerian set of orbital parameters

% orbital altitude (km) is used to compute semimajor axis for a circular
% orbit
altitude = 600E3;
semimajor_axis = altitude + earthRadius();
% eccentricity is 0 for a circular orbit. this is a measure of how
% elliptical an orbit is
eccentricity = 0;
% for a sun-synchronous circular orbit, inclination is a function of
% altitude only. we provide a function which can compute the requires
% inclination
inclination = SunSynchronousPolarOrbit(altitude/1000);
% these parameters control the orbit's orientation wrt the earth's surface
right_ascension_of_ascending_node = -1.5;
argument_of_periapsis = 0;
% true anomaly describes where the satellite lies in its orbit
true_anomaly = 0;

% simulation time window- most LEO orbits have more than 1 viable pass per
% day. pick one!
pass_time = datetime(2022,12,25,6,56,0);
%pass_time = datetime(2022,12,25,16,19,0);
%pass_time = datetime(2022,12,25,17,54,0);
% simulation duration. an hour is plenty to cover a full pass inlcuding
% acquisition
duration = minutes(60);
% sample time. 1s samples is the default. longer samples will give better
% performance
sample_time = seconds(1);
% we need to pass a start and stop time

stop_time = pass_time + duration / 2;

% using

% 2.1.3 detector
% we provide details of some preset detectors. custom detectors can also be 
% instantiated by providing their details. As well as performance data, the detector

% and a downlink beacon camera
% 2.2.1 downlink beacon camera
% the camera also requires a telescope


% construct downlink beacon camera telescope
