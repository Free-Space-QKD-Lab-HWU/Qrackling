%% A full worked example of a satellite pass simulation
% there are 4 key steps to any simulation:
% 1. a transmitter  (here, a satellite)
% 2. a receiver     (here, a ground station)
% 3. run simulations
% 4. plot results


%% 1. construct a transmitter (satellite)
% to do this, we need lots of details about the satellite, including 
% 1.1 quantum transmitter details
% 1.2 beacon details (optional)
% 1.3 orbit details
% then we can:
% 1.4 construct satellite

% 1.1.1 source

    'Pointing_Jitter', pointing_jitter);



% 1.2.1 downlink beacon laser details
% see the above paper for beacon details. beacon simulations are optional
% and do not affect quantum channel performance (as pointing performance is
% specified by a jitter value)
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% beacon optical power in w
downlink_beacon_power = 2;
% beacon wavelength in nm
downlink_beacon_wavelength = 685;
% beacon optical efficiency (unitless)

% beacon pointing precision (coarse pointing precision) in rads
% note that to make this calculation worst-case, this should be the
% open-loop pointing precision before acquisition
downlink_beacon_pointing_precision = 1E-3;
% beacon telescope diameter (m)
downlink_beacon_telescope_diameter = 0.01;
% beacon telescope field of view (rads)
downlink_beacon_telescope_fov = deg2rad(0.4);
% create a beacon telescope object

% beacon profile but a gaussian beacon is also available
link_beacon = beacon.Flat_Top_Beacon(downlink_beacon_telescope, downlink_beacon_power, downlink_beacon_wavelength);

% 1.2.2 downlink beacon camera details

% 1.3 orbit details
% there are many parameters which describe an orbit. we choose to use
% keplerian parameters. as well as these, we must also provide a time
% window to simulate (ideally, the satellite would pass the ground station
% in this time)
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% orbital parameters- these conform to the MATLAB satellite communications
% toolbox keplerian set of orbital parameters

% orbital altitude (km) is used to compute semimajor axis for a circular
% orbit
altitude = 600E3;
semimajor_axis = altitude + earthRadius();
% eccentricity is 0 for a circular orbit. this is a measure of how
% elliptical an orbit is
eccentricity = 0;
% for a sun-synchronous circular orbit, inclination is a function of
% altitude only. we provide a function which can compute the requires
% inclination
inclination = SunSynchronousPolarOrbit(altitude/1000);
% these parameters control the orbit's orientation wrt the earth's surface
right_ascension_of_ascending_node = -1.5;
argument_of_periapsis = 0;
% true anomaly describes where the satellite lies in its orbit
true_anomaly = 0;

% simulation time window- most LEO orbits have more than 1 viable pass per
% day. pick one!
pass_time = datetime(2022,12,25,6,56,0);
%pass_time = datetime(2022,12,25,16,19,0);
%pass_time = datetime(2022,12,25,17,54,0);
% simulation duration. an hour is plenty to cover a full pass inlcuding
% acquisition
duration = minutes(60);
% sample time. 1s samples is the default. longer samples will give better
% performance
sample_time = seconds(1);
% we need to pass a start and stop time
start_time = pass_time - duration/2;

%% 2. construct a receiver (ground station)
% to do this, we need lots of details about the ground station
% 2.1 quantum receiver details

% alternatively, a dummy spectral filter can be created which has a
% brick-wall spectral response using
% spectral_filter = IdeadBPFilter(centre_wavelength, spectral_width)

% 2.1.3 detector
% we provide details of some preset detectors. custom detectors can also be
% instantiated by providing their details. As well as performance data, the
% detector requires channel information to compute QBER.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% time gate width in s

% declared
% construct detector
detector = components.Detector(QKD_wavelength, source_rep_rate, ...
